This subfolder contains scripts used for extra detection output. Some javascript may be present for mocking remote servers.

Expect python 3.9.5. Use a virtual env with `python -m venv venv`. Activate on windows with `. venv/Scripts/activate`. Install requirements with `pip -r requirements.txt`. 

Optionally npm install express and run the mock server with `node mock_server.js`.
